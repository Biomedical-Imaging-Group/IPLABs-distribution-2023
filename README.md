Welcome to your Noto folder for the Image Processing laboratories!

By clicking the provided link on Moodle after the release of each lab, this folder will be automatically updated with the new assignments, while your changes in old assignments will remain. If at any point, you want to get a fresh copy of any of the labs, simply delete it here and click the link again.

When you have finished the assignment, download ONLY the notebooks, without the folder of images. Then place the notebooks in a folder and compress it to get a `zip` file, other formats such as `rar` are not accepted when you upload on the submission portal on Moodle! Please refer to the submission guidelines for each lab on Moodle for details including the naming of the folder and the submission deadline.

Enjoy!
